#==========================================================================
I am currently in  the process of transforming our lab pipeline for EEG preprocessing from EEGLAB in MATLAB to a constellation of processing techniques in Python. 
This script serves as a fundament for my thinking in this process, and should at this point not be treated as a fully ready-to-use script. 
The main aim of sharing this script at this moment is to share the logic of our work in the SynCoRe lab.
